# Welcome to The Random Comedy.
You find yourself in a dark forest, not knowing how you got there or how long it has been.
A spirit approaches and introduces himself as Bary, the Baryonic Person.
Bary has lost his body many years ago when he was a child living on another planet.
He can no longer remember when and how. You two strike a deal: you help Bary get his body back,
and Bary helps you find your way back. Apparently Bary is a hobby philosopher and a dilettante of sciences.

Embark on a journey through Dante's realms, collecting elements along the way to create a body.
The human body consists of 61 chemical elements which are possible to attain in the game throughout the levels.
Practically every level in Dante's cosmology, that is the scene for the Divine Comedy is a real place in the universe,
be it in Earths inner core, Canto 34, Satan's place, to the oceans and planets. The element values for each level
are sourced from scientific papers, wikis and similar and attempt to recreate as truthfully as possible the chemical
composition of each place.
Some places, like Terme dei Papi, are mentioned in the Comedy, but are not assigned any spesific Canto number,
and are the so-called Extra levels. Terme dei Papi's chemical composition of the still existing public baths
in Viterbo, Italy, is taken from the big sign by the sulphur pool side.

Each level have different number of possible shuffle clicks, as each level of Dante's cosmology can span through
several Cantos. So the number of levels is ~35, while the number of possible shuffle clicks are at least 100.

Collect all 61 elements to win the game, pick up some noble gases and Platinum as bonus elements, but be caerful,
as some elements are rare so you have to create strategies to get them all. This is a work in progress.

Good luck!

        <h1>Welcome to The Random Comedy.</h1>
        <p>You find yourself in a dark forest, not knowing how you got there or how long it has been.<br>
        A spirit approaches and introduces himself as Bary, the Baryonic Person.<br>
        Bary has lost his body many years ago when he was a child living on another planet.<br>
        He can no longer remember when and how. You two strike a deal: you help Bary get his body back,<br>
        and Bary helps you find your way back. Apparently Bary is a hobby philosopher and a dilettante of sciences. </p>
        <p>Embark on a journey through Dante's realms, collecting elements along the way to create a body.<br>
        The human body consists of 61 chemical elements which are possible to attain in the game throughout the levels.<br>
        Practically every level in Dante's cosmology, that is the scene for the Divine Comedy is a real place in the universe,<br>
        be it in Earths inner core, Canto 34, Satan's place, to the oceans and planets. The element values for each level<br>
        are sourced from scientific papers, wikis and similar and attempt to recreate as truthfully as possible the chemical<br>
        composition of each place.<br>
        Some places, like Terme dei Papi, are mentioned in the Comedy, but are not assigned any spesific Canto number,<br>
        and are the so-called Extra levels. Terme dei Papi's chemical composition of the still existing public baths<br>
        in Viterbo, Italy, is taken from the big sign by the sulphur pool side.
        </p>
        <p>Each level have different number of possible shuffle clicks, as each level of Dante's cosmology can span through<br>
        several Cantos. So the number of levels is ~35, while the number of possible shuffle clicks are at least 100.</p>
        <p>Collect all 61 elements to win the game, pick up some noble gases and Platinum as bonus elements, but be caerful,<br>
        as some elements are rare so you have to create strategies to get them all. This is a work in progress.</p>
        <p>Good luck!</p>
